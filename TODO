   = <leader>/ does :Rg (Make sure this works well, open a new tab before running Rg, check the jumplist, setup keys to move through the jumplist)
   = / Does fuzzy
   = ? Does regular /
   = https://github.com/haya14busa/vim-asterisk (set z star as default)

   = Do this too. See if you like it. Turn it on for z star.

   - incsearch plugin is no longer necessary. It's in main vim/nvim. Just use this one and drop the other two

   - Maybe this, I feel like it would be slow for very large buffers. So maybe skip it. https://github.com/osyo-manga/vim-anzu

   = replace easymotion
      x remove easymotion
      - remove easymotion files
      - setup hop 
         - setup commands
            - setup paste anywhere command
            - setup command to delete inside and paste something
         - setup colors
      - setup fuzzy incremental search that sets up the hop list
         - maybe fix pounce?
         - maybe you don't need fuzzy search because it works?
      - setup pounce
         - setup commands
         - setup colors
   = manage hover with:
      - make it auto hover hover. and then you can "q" out
      - https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/37225/how-do-i-close-a-hovered-window-with-lsp-information-escape-does-not-work
      - vim.lsp.buf.hover
   = setup lsp
      - learn the commands. use them. gd (go to declaration)
   = finish colors
      - write scripts to copy groups
         - syntax, tree sitter, lsp
      - strip out solarized
      - just put everything in colors.vim / colors.lua
         - maybe break it out into a directory
            - import common everywhere.
            - /colors/common.lua
            - /colors/javascript.lua
            - /colors/hop.lua
            - /colors/pounce.lua
         - drop old javascript highlighting
   = setup snippets
      - remove ultisnip
      - look into snippet plugins (luasnip)
      - setup luasnip (implement old ultisnip snippets)
   - figure out code completion
      - setup cmp, lsp, mason
      - try ctrl+space completion instead of tab?
      ? "google best code completion neovim"
      - turn off complete for vim command line ":"
      - turn off complete for plain text files? like notes? it's weird.
   
   - fix colors -- just strip out js and solarized stuff and make one big color.vim
   - basically redo the core bundle stuff. look for faster / better code highlighting
   - learn wordmotions
   - maybe write your own tabout. tabout seems shitty
   - look for automatic setup of all your plugins. doing it by hand is a pain.
   - fix all the weird ruby / python dependencies once and for all (if you can).
   - do a lockfile! (https://shyr.io/blog/vim-plugin-lockfile)

= setup tux
   - create a tux init . <name> which will add this directory to the tux. 
      - rewrite tux with new dry. should take like 2 hours.
      - name the tmux window! 
   - do tux tab <name> to start it in a new iterm tab.
   - use paths as the tmux name - and have aliases
      - support tux move Projects/dry/dry-wip/dry-underscore projects/dry/baseline
      - support tux move du projects/dry/baseline

   = alias this stuff
      - fzf tux init
      - fzf tux ls (can you show a description but only search and pull out the first string?)

= shell
   - blow away the old dotfiles repo. force push over the old github. save the old one locally in an archive (you need to figure out archiving old projects anyway).
   - finish fixing the zsh config and (maybe) the bash config. i don't know if it's short circuited
   - change the name of the master branch to main

= /dropbox/system and 
   - figure this out. copy plat and term and local
   - clean up and remove /dropbox/system.old


= done

   x setup fzf 
      x fix up the keybinding code in your own files. 

   x fix ls
      / move to eza
         x nope! coreutils ls is the best.
      x alias everything
      x fix colors 
         x especially weird background color
      x drop lscolors
      x fix ls_colors

x vim
   x fix the backspace issue in command-t and fix up the styling and options!
   x fix tree sitter (i think this is fixed)
   x open treesitter on a dry include bundle and see what happens.
      x you want treesitter. it's way faster. "G" to the bottom and see how slow regex is
   x fix autopairs. it sucks because it adds a " even if the next character is a letter.
      x try delimitmate again
