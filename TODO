= vim
   - fix the backspace issue in command-t and fix up the styling and options!
   - fix tree sitter
   - learn wordmotions
   - maybe write your own tabout. tabout seems shitty
   - figure out code completion
      ? "google best code completion neovim"
   - fix colors -- just strip out js and solarized stuff and make one big color.vim
   - basically redo the core bundle stuff. look for faster / better code highlighting
   - look for automatic setup of all your plugins. doing it by hand is a pain.
   - fix all the weird ruby / python dependencies once and for all (if you can).
   - do a lockfile! (https://shyr.io/blog/vim-plugin-lockfile)

= shell
   - blow away the old dotfiles repo. force push over the old github. save the old one locally in an archive (you need to figure out archiving old projects anyway).
   - finish fixing the zsh config and (maybe) the bash config. i don't know if it's short circuited
   - change the name of the master branch to main

= /dropbox/system and 
   - figure this out. copy plat and term and local
   - clean up and remove /dropbox/system.old
