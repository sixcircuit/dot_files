= vim
   - figure out code completion
      - setup cmp, lsp, mason, try ctrl+space completion instead of tab?
      ? "google best code completion neovim"
   - fix colors -- just strip out js and solarized stuff and make one big color.vim
   - basically redo the core bundle stuff. look for faster / better code highlighting
   - learn wordmotions
   - maybe write your own tabout. tabout seems shitty
   - look for automatic setup of all your plugins. doing it by hand is a pain.
   - fix all the weird ruby / python dependencies once and for all (if you can).
   - do a lockfile! (https://shyr.io/blog/vim-plugin-lockfile)

= setup tux
   - create a tux init . <name> which will add this directory to the tux. 
      - rewrite tux with new dry. should take like 2 hours.
      - name the tmux window! 
   - do tux tab <name> to start it in a new iterm tab.

   = alias this stuff
      - fzf tux init
      - fzf tux ls (can you show a description but only search and pull out the first string?)

= shell
   - blow away the old dotfiles repo. force push over the old github. save the old one locally in an archive (you need to figure out archiving old projects anyway).
   - finish fixing the zsh config and (maybe) the bash config. i don't know if it's short circuited
   - change the name of the master branch to main

= /dropbox/system and 
   - figure this out. copy plat and term and local
   - clean up and remove /dropbox/system.old


= done

   x setup fzf 
      x fix up the keybinding code in your own files. 

   x fix ls
      / move to eza
         x nope! coreutils ls is the best.
      x alias everything
      x fix colors 
         x especially weird background color
      x drop lscolors
      x fix ls_colors

x vim
   x fix the backspace issue in command-t and fix up the styling and options!
   x fix tree sitter (i think this is fixed)
   x open treesitter on a dry include bundle and see what happens.
      x you want treesitter. it's way faster. "G" to the bottom and see how slow regex is
   x fix autopairs. it sucks because it adds a " even if the next character is a letter.
      x try delimitmate again
