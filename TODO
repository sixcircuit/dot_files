= shell
   - commit the local files, then remove them from the tracking. then link in your own. maybe put this in the home directory and keep it out of the repo all together
   - your local files are currently hardcopied into the home directory.
   - look at /ignore and link them to local.
   - blow away the old dotfiles repo. force push over the old github. save the old one locally in an archive (you need to figure out archiving old projects anyway).
   - finish fixing the zsh config and (maybe) the bash config. i don't know if it's short circuited

= vim
   - fix the vim config. move to vim-plug. fix it up. make it easy. it's pretty good right now. maybe move to tree sitter?
   - basically redo the core bundle stuff. look for faster / better code highlighting
   - look for automatic setup of all your plugins. doing it by hand is a pain.
   - fix all the weird ruby / python dependencies once and for all (if you can).
