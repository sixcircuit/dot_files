   - completion (rename, gd go to definition)
   - move myi mpi m" m' m[

= longterm
   - move tabline to lightline and get rid of tabline
   - maybe write your own tabout. tabout seems shitty
   - hack support into command-t lua for:
      . it doesn't show you the matches anymore.
      - exe "hi! CommandTCharMatched" .s:fmt_bold .s:fg_orange .s:bg_none
   - look into these other options for moving and selecting tree sitter nodes / objects

      - look into snippet plugins (luasnip)
      - setup luasnip (implement old ultisnip snippets)

   = figure out code completion
      x setup cmp, lsp, mason
      x "google best code completion neovim"
      - try ctrl+space completion instead of tab?
      - turn off complete for plain text files? like notes? it's weird.
      / turn off complete for vim command line ":"

   - do a lockfile! (https://shyr.io/blog/vim-plugin-lockfile)

= shell
   - blow away the old dotfiles repo. force push over the old github. save the old one locally in an archive (you need to figure out archiving old projects anyway).
   - finish fixing the zsh config and (maybe) the bash config. i don't know if it's short circuited
   - change the name of the master branch to main

= /dropbox/system
   - figure this out. copy plat and term and local
   - clean up and remove /dropbox/system.old

      x fix colors
         x especially weird background color
      x drop lscolors
      x fix ls_colors

x vim
   x fix the backspace issue in command-t and fix up the styling and options!
   x fix tree sitter (i think this is fixed)
   x open treesitter on a dry include bundle and see what happens.
      x you want treesitter. it's way faster. "G" to the bottom and see how slow regex is
   x fix autopairs. it sucks because it adds a " even if the next character is a letter.
      x try delimitmate again

   x https://github.com/haya14busa/vim-asterisk (set z star as default)

   x Do this too. See if you like it. Turn it on for z star.

      x ? does :Rg (Make sure this works well, open a new tab before running Rg, check the jumplist, setup keys to move through the jumplist)
      x / Does fuzzy
      x ? Does regular /

   x fuzzy find
      x https://github.com/ggvgc/vim-fuzzysearch
      x https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/14465/fuzzy-find-within-buffer
      x incsearch plugin is no longer necessary. It's in main vim/nvim. Just use this one and drop the other two

   x maybe this, i feel like it would be slow for very large buffers. so maybe skip it. https://github.com/osyo-manga/vim-anzu (don't need it, built into neovim)

   x look for automatic setup of all your plugins. doing it by hand is a pain.
   x fix all the weird ruby / python dependencies once and for all (if you can).

      - figured out how to setup native spelling support for treesitter

   x fix showTrailingWhitespace
      / doesn't show up in both buffers if they're both on the same vsplit.
      / at least not reliably. don't know what's going on.

      x fix colors -- just strip out js and solarized stuff and make one big color.vim
      x basically redo the core bundle stuff. look for faster / better code highlighting
      x write scripts to copy groups
         x syntax, tree sitter, lsp
      x strip out solarized
      x just put everything in colors.vim / colors.lua
         / maybe break it out into a directory

      x https://github.com/norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua

   x colors are coming along. keep working on it.
