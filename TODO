= shell
   - blow away the old dotfiles repo. force push over the old github. save the old one locally in an archive (you need to figure out archiving old projects anyway).
   - finish fixing the zsh config and (maybe) the bash config. i don't know if it's short circuited
   - change the name of the master branch to main

= vim
   - fix the vim config. move to vim-plug. fix it up. make it easy. it's pretty good right now. maybe move to tree sitter?
   - basically redo the core bundle stuff. look for faster / better code highlighting
   - look for automatic setup of all your plugins. doing it by hand is a pain.
   - fix all the weird ruby / python dependencies once and for all (if you can).

= /dropbox/system and 
   - figure this out. copy plat and term and local
   - clean up and remove /dropbox/system.old
